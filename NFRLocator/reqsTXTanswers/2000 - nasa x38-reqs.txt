The application can use this time on the ICP to initialize I/O boards.
System Initialization shall [SRS215] call an application initialization function to allow the application to (at least) create tasks, create communication sockets, initialize the vehicle mode, and initialize memory alignment allowance.
The FCP shall [SRS221], after application initialization is complete, send an FCP Ready Sync message to the ICP 14.
The FCP shall [SRS189] wait up to 2.5 seconds (from the sending of the FCP Ready Sync) for the ICP Ready signal.
Note that FTSS will not fail the FCR if this signal is not received within this time.

The scheduler shall [SRS029] report rate group over-runs to the application via an API service for incorporation in the telemetry data stream.
The scheduler shall [SRS216] provide an API call to specify which task was running within the rate group which over-ran.

The scheduler shall [SRS034] take no longer than 1 millisecond to execute scheduler and Time Services FTSS overhead tasks in each rate group.
This means that the time from the 50 Hz timer interrupt to the start of the first task in the 50 Hz rate group will be less than or equal to 1 millisecond, assuming 27 packets of data need to be delivered.
The FTSS software shall [SRS278] provide an API call that provides the application program the minor frame number.

The scheduler shall [SRS037] provide a method to schedule tasks at a set rate and in a set order within the rate group.
The scheduler shall [SRS198] execute all the tasks in each of the rate groups that have been installed in the current mode.
The scheduler shall [SRS039] rely on the order used in adding tasks to a rate group to determine the task priorities.
The scheduler shall [SRS042] provide a method for a task to be scheduled as a 50 Hz "helper" task for source congruency input exchanges and voted output exchanges that starts in a particular minor frame but runs only during every 5th or 50th minor frame, effectively running at a lower, sub-rate, 10 Hz or 1 Hz, respectively.
The scheduler shall [SRS270] provide a task deadline capability that allows the application to specify which minor frame a task should start in and finish in.
Upon the occurrence of an exception of either kind (hardware or software), the FCP shall [SRS172] make the error type available to the application, via an API service, for incorporation in the telemetry stream and include all context data relevant to the exception, namely the contents of the Machine State Register (MSR), and the machine status Save/Restore Registers (SRR0 & SRR1).
The scheduler shall [SRS031] provide a mechanism for a task optionally to define a user written software-exception-handling routine that runs in the context of the task.
For hardware exceptions and reserved exceptions, the FTSS shall [SRS276] make the error type and its context data available to the application, then return from the exception handler to the task that was running when the exception occurred.
For software exceptions occurring within the FTSS, the FTSS shall [SRS277] make the error type and its context data available to the application, then restart the offending task at its beginning.
For other software exceptions, regardless of whether or not a user written exception handling routine is invoked, if an exception occurs, the scheduler shall [SRS173], after making available the error type and context data to the application, resume processing (after the exception-handling routine runs, if provided) at the initialization point of the offending task.

"Pipes" provide fast data throughput between virtual groups or within a virtual group when minimal data latency is necessary.
Communication services shall [SRS049] provide the capability to "broadcast" messages to all virtual groups.
Communication services shall [SRS050] restrict the use of "immediate" message passing services between virtual groups (from FCP to ICP) to tasks running in the highest rate group on the FCP.
This restriction does NOT apply to the ICPs since they are running as simplex VGs.
Communication services shall [SRS051] detect message passing between application tasks living on the same virtual group and bypass the usage of the network element.
Communication services shall [SRS052] route messages to the proper virtual group(s) and socket.
Communication services shall [SRS053] deliver messages in the same order at each member of a virtual group.
Communication services shall [SRS054] perform synchronous message passing at rate group frame boundaries.
This ensures that all redundant instantiations of a given rate group task have consistent messages throughout the rate group frame.
Communication services shall [SRS235] detect a babbling NE or ICP within 20 milliseconds of the receipt of the first erroneous packet.
FTSS shall [SRS255] mask out a babbling NE or ICP within 40 milliseconds after it is detected.
Sockets used for "synchronous" message passing behave differently than those used for "immediate" message passing.
Synchronous message passing sockets shall [SRS055] queue outgoing messages until they are transmitted at frame boundaries.
The "create" and "open" API calls for synchronous sockets allow the application to specify the maximum message size and how many incoming messages the socket may buffer.
If there is insufficient space to enqueue a message for transmission, Communication services shall [SRS059] return an error to the corresponding task.
Communication services shall [SRS062] provide a message queue communication mechanism that guarantees message delivery between a sending and receiving task.
Communication services shall [SRS063] provide an API for "message queue" communication.

The message queue "create" API requires the application to specify the sending and receiving virtual group identifiers.
Communication services shall [SRS066] only allow a single task living on each specified virtual group to "open" the respective end of the queue.
3.2.4.1.2 Pipe Sockets "Pipe" sockets are used for "immediate" communication.
They may be created with a broadcast capability.
Pipes may only be opened by one sending task.
Pipes may be opened by multiple receiving tasks if they are created with the "broadcast" capability; otherwise they may only be opened by one receiving task.
Pipes are the only broadcast mechanism available to the application.
Communication services shall [SRS067] provide a "pipe" communication mechanism allowing immediate message passing through the network and allowing a 50hz FCP transfer task to poll until it can read an immediate message from the ICP.
Communication services shall [SRS068] provide an API for "pipe" communication.
Communication services shall [SRS069] provide the capability to create "pipe"s which "broadcast" their messages to all virtual groups.
Communication services shall [SRS070] provide the following error handling information as feedback to the "pipe" API calls: a) notification of invalid or out of range application specified parameters on all operations, b) notification of an attempt to create a broadcast pipe with an ICP as the sending virtual group, c) pipe "open" of end point ( SENDER/RECEIVER ) by non-assigned virtual group, d) notification upon receiving a message that the previous message was overwritten, e) connection/transmission error, f) FTSS unable to create/open pipe, and g) notification that a received message was truncated to the buffer size provided.
If the broadcast option is used, each virtual group should open the pipe and read from it to avoid flow control problems.
The "pipe" "create" API requires the application to specify the sending and receiving virtual group identifiers.
Communication services shall [SRS073] only allow a single task living on each specified virtual group to "open" the respective end of the pipe.

Redundancy Management shall [SRS101] define an initial mapping of physical hardware to virtual group identifiers consisting of 1 quadruplex FCP virtual group and 5 ICP simplexes.
If an FCR is diagnosed as faulty during Startup, Redundancy Management shall [SRS102] exclude the FCP in the faulty channel from the initial FCP virtual group configuration.
Redundancy Management shall [SRS104] implement the following strategies to reconfigure hardware resources: a) degrade the FCP virtual group, b) re-integrate an FCP processor into the FCP virtual group, c) re-integrate a Network Element, or d) mask a Network Element.
When the FCP virtual group is configured as a quadruplex and a failed FCR other than the NEFU has been diagnosed, Redundancy Management shall [SRS106] degrade the FCP virtual group to triplex, removing the FCR.
When the FCP virtual group is configured as a triplex, and if the NEFU is still active (4 NEs active total), and a failed FCR other than the NEFU has been diagnosed, Redundancy Management shall [SRS282] degrade the FCP virtual group to degraded triplex, removing the FCR.
If the FCP is configured as a triplex, and if the NEFU is not still active (3 NEs active total), and another failure in the FCP FCR is diagnosed, Redundancy Management shall [SRS284] mask out the processors on the failed FCR.
The NE will remain in the CT and no recovery will take place.
Note that a failed FCR could be diagnosed using any method, including (but not limited to) Continuous BIT, ICP presence test, or NE syndrome analysis.
If a failure in an FCR other than the NEFU is diagnosed when the FCP is configured as a degraded triplex, no action shall [SRS254] be taken.
Note that a failed FCR could be diagnosed using any method, including (but not limited to) Continuous BIT, ICP presence test, or NE syndrome analysis.
For the NEFU, if the first failure is diagnosed, Redundancy Management shall [SRS245] issue a configuration update to mask out the failed processor.
Note that the NE is allowed to remain in the configuration and no recovery will take place.

From the time that the FCR failure has been identified, if the components of the FCR are recoverable and alignment is permitted, to the time the FCR is recovered, shall [SRS205] be no more than 1.5 minutes.
Redundancy Management shall [SRS208], within 60 milliseconds after 1.5 minutes has elapsed since the voted reset was sent to the failed channel, if the voted reset fails to recover the failed channel and alignment is still allowed, request from the application a power cycle of the channel.
(Note that NEFU recovery does not depend on whether alignment is permitted.) 15.
Redundancy Management shall [SRS209], within 60 milliseconds after 1.5 minutes has elapsed since the first power cycle request, if the FCR has not been recovered and alignment is still allowed, issue another request to the application for a power cycle of the channel.
(Note that NEFU recovery does not depend on whether alignment is permitted.) 16.
